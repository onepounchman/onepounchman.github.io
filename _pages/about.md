Welcome! I am a third-year Statistics PhD student at [University of California Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu).  I am supervised by professor [Hengrui Cai](https://hengruicai.github.io/). Previously, I studied Biostatistics as a master student at the [University of Washington](https://www.biostat.washington.edu). Prior to UW, I received my BSc in Applied Mathematics from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/). 

**Research Interests:** I have broad research interests in general machine learning. Specifically, my research interests lie in:
- **Large Language Models**, e.g., uncertainty estimation from generation, efficient and robust benchmark, RLHF, etc.
- **Reinforcement Learning**, e.g. online/offline RL, off policy evaluation, etc.
