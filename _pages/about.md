I am a fourth year PhD student in the department of Statistics & Data Science at the University of Texas at Austin. I am supervised by professor [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Before coming to UT, I completed my Master degree at Columbia University in Data Science major. I received my Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from Tongji University in China, during which I went to the University of California, Berkeley for one year exchange study.

**Research Interests:** I have broad research interests in statistical machine learning. Specifically, my research interests lie in:
- **Deep generative models**, e.g. diffusion models, GANs, etc. 
- **Reinforcement Learning**, e.g. online/offline RL, imitation learning, etc.
- **Multimodal Large Language Models**, e.g., interleaved text-image generation, preference optimization algorithms, etc.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**, e.g. conformal predictions, etc.

I am set to graduate in December 2024. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you're interested in my research or have potential opportunities to discuss.
