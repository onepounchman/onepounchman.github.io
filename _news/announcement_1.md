Our new paper **Probabilistic Conformal Prediction Using Conditional Random Samples** was accepted as **Spotlight** presentation at [ICML Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification, 2022](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/dfuq-22/home)! The pdf is public on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06584) and the code was released on [Github](https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Probabilistic-Conformal-Prediction).
